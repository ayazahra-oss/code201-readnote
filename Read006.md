# Problem domain

A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is
simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else. For example, when developing
a system to measure good practice in medicine, carpet drawings at hospitals would not be included in the problem domain.
In this example, the domain refers to relevant topics solely within the delimited area of interest: medicine.
This points to a limitation of an overly specific, or overly bounded, problem domain.
An individual may think they are interested in medicine and not interior design,
but a better solution exists outside of the problem domain as it was initially conceived.
For example, when IDEO researchers noticed that patients in hospitals spent a huge amount of time staring at
acoustic ceiling tiles, which "became a symbol of the overall ambiance: a mix of boredom and anxiety from feeling lost, uninformed, and out of control."

# Objects 
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of
a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

# The Document Object Model (DOM)
specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes and text nodes.
You can select element nodes by their id or clas attributes,by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a nodelist.
In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent(and is apopular reason for using jQuery).
