## Chapter 10. Debugging and Error Handling




JavaScript can be hard to learn and everyone makes mistakes when writing it. This chapter will help you learn how to find the errors in your code. It will also teach you how to write scripts that deal with potential errors gracefully.

When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time. Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it, too.

When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right in their first attempt. The error messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, but they can help you determine what went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it. In this chapter you will learn about:

THE CONSOLE & DEV TOOLS
Tools built into the browser that help you hunt for errors.

COMMON PROBLEMS
Common sources of errors, and how to solve them.

HANDLING ERRORS
How code can deal with potential errors gracefully.

ORDER OF EXECUTION
To find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed. The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run:

## 10.1. Gracefully Handling No JavaScript Support
## Problem
You want to ensure your pages work as well with JavaScript turned off as when it’s turned on.

Solution
One approach is to the use the noscript element to provide alternative functionality:

<script type="text/javascript">
document.writeln("<p>Some content</p>");
</script>
<noscript><p>Fall back account</p></noscript>
However, more modern applications make an assumption that JavaScript is turned off, and ensure the page works correctly script-free. Once that’s taken care of, we add script to make the page more interactive.

Discussion
Several years ago, it wasn’t uncommon to find script blocks scattered about a page, generating web page content on the fly. To ensure that something showed up even if scripting was turned off, the developers would match the script with a noscript element. This noscript element would provide fallback page content or information. The noscript element has gone out of favor, and is listed as obsolete in HTML5. Now, web developers create the entire page and all of its content without any scripting enabled. Then, and only then, they’ll add script to make the page more helpful, interactive, or even fun.

For example, a web page can have several form elements. It’s workable, but having many form elements can take up a lot of space. However, the form elements have to be available if scripting is turned off.

To solve the problem, the developer can style the form elements to be displayed by default, and then use JavaScript to turn off the display of some of the elements when the page loads. Based on the web page reader’s actions, form elements will be displayed and hidden as needed. This ensures that the form elements are always available and only hidden when support for scripting is ensured.

Example 10-1 shows a very simple implementation of this type of functionality. If scripting is turned off, all of the form elements display by default. If scripting is turned on, however, the text input elements in the lower part of the form are hidden when the page is loaded (note emphasized code), and only displayed when the second radio button is clicked.
